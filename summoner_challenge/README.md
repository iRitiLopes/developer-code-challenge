# Development Code challenge!

Welcome to Datenworks summoner code challenge, this is a code challenge that you
will need to use some data, combining them and show some output information.

## About the Challenge

You have two data files in CSV format. Those files contain statistics about
League of Legends champions.

We need to know from the strongest to the weakest order, the name and the DPS of each champion.
Do not print any other information and make sure there are no duplicates.

The Formula to calculate the Damage Per Second(DPS) is:  
  DPS = ATTACK_DAMAGE * ATTACK_SPEED

### Requirements:

* Clone this project
* Inside the Summoner_Challlenge Folder install all dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Execute the project usingn ```python -m flask run```
* Access in your browser localhost:5000/

## Evaluation Method

Your code will be under review of the Datenworks Engineering team.

What we will consider on this evaluation:
- **Performance**
- **Unit Tests**
- **Isolation of responsibilities**
- **Software Engineering concerns (cohesion, reusability, etc)**

Feel free to implement it the way you feel more confortable :)

GOOD LUCK!
